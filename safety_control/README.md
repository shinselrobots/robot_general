# Safety_control

# Info
   This node provides basic collision / cliff detection and prevention
   To simplify behavior, potential collisions are detected by "zones" around the robot
   as defined in SafetySensorSummary

# Hints
   - Tune how long the robot stays stopped by modifying "timeout" in param/cmd_vel_mux.yaml
   - Make sure you remap /cmd_vel in your launch file
   - Tune for robot using parameters shown in the launch file.

# Prerequisites
   (there may be a better way to add these packages...?)
   - modify "cmd_vel_mux.yaml" to add this safety controller:
        name:        "Safety Control"
        topic:       "safety_control"
        timeout:     1.0
        priority:    5

   - Install required packages:
         sudo apt -y install ros-kinetic-tf
         sudo apt -y install ros-kinetic-tf2-sensor-msgs
       Optional, if using pointcloud laserscan option: 
         sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-pointcloud-to-laserscan
